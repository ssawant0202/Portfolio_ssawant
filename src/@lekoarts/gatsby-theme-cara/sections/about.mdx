> Hardwork Beats Talent When Talent Doesn't Work Hard!

I like learning new things and getting out of my comfort zone, which helps me to expand my skill set. I am proficient in C++, JAVA, and Python. Coding has always been my passion; learning new languages never tires me out. 
I enjoy playing Table Tennis, Badminton and Chess.
